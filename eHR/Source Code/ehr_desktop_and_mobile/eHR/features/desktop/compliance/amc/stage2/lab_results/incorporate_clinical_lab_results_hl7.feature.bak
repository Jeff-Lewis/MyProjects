Feature: AMC - Verification of Numerator and Denominator changes - Incorporate Clinical Lab Results - HL7 part - Stage 2

  Background:
    Given login as "non EP"
    And currently in "AMC" page

  @tc_6236
  Scenario: Verification of Stage 2 Incorporated Clinical Lab Results takes into account numeric lab results created by HL7
    And get "all" details of "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" under "core set" for "stage2 ep" as "within report range"
    # Numeric, Multiple, Negative, Not Positive Negative Numeric or Inconclusive, Positive
    When an HL-7 message with Lab order "within report range" and "Numeric" Lab result "within report range" is sent
    Then the "numerator and denominator" of "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" under "core set" should be "increased" by "1"
    And "a record" should be in "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" numerator report under "core set"

    When an HL-7 message with Lab order "within report range" and "Numeric" Lab result "outside report range" is sent
    Then the "numerator and denominator" of "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" under "core set" should be "increased" by "1"
    And "a record" should be in "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" numerator report under "core set"

  @tc_6237
  Scenario: Verification of Stage 2 Incorporated Clinical Lab Results takes into account positive lab results created by HL7
    And get "all" details of "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" under "core set" for "stage2 ep" as "within report range"
    When an HL-7 message with Lab order "within report range" and "Positive" Lab result "within report range" is sent
    Then the "numerator and denominator" of "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" under "core set" should be "increased" by "1"
    And "a record" should be in "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" numerator report under "core set"

    When an HL-7 message with Lab order "within report range" and "Positive" Lab result "outside report range" is sent
    Then the "numerator and denominator" of "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" under "core set" should be "increased" by "1"
    And "a record" should be in "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" numerator report under "core set"

  @tc_6238
  Scenario: Verification of Stage 2 Incorporated Clinical Lab Results takes into account negative lab results created by HL7
    And get "all" details of "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" under "core set" for "stage2 ep" as "within report range"
    When an HL-7 message with Lab order "within report range" and "Negative" Lab result "within report range" is sent
    Then the "numerator and denominator" of "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" under "core set" should be "increased" by "1"
    And "a record" should be in "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" numerator report under "core set"

    When an HL-7 message with Lab order "within report range" and "Negative" Lab result "outside report range" is sent
    Then the "numerator and denominator" of "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" under "core set" should be "increased" by "1"
    And "a record" should be in "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" numerator report under "core set"

  @tc_6239
  Scenario: Verification of Stage 2 Incorporated Clinical Lab Results does not take into account HL7 results which are not positive, negative or numeric
    And get "all" details of "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" under "core set" for "stage2 ep" as "within report range"
    When an HL-7 message with Lab order "within report range" and "Inconclusive" Lab result "within report range" is sent
    Then the "numerator and denominator" of "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" under "core set" should be "increased" by "0"
    And "invalid record" should not be in "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" numerator report under "core set"

    When an HL-7 message with Lab order "within report range" and "Inconclusive" Lab result "outside report range" is sent
    Then the "numerator and denominator" of "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" under "core set" should be "increased" by "0"
    And "invalid record" should not be in "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" numerator report under "core set"

  @tc_6240
  Scenario: Verification of Stage 2 Incorporated Clinical Lab Results does not take into account HL7 lab orders and results added outside reporting period
    And get "all" details of "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" under "core set" for "stage2 ep" as "outside report range"
    When an HL-7 message with Lab order "outside report range" and "Numeric" Lab result "outside report range" is sent
    Then the "numerator and denominator" of "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" under "core set" should be "increased" by "0"
    And "invalid record" should not be in "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" numerator report under "core set"

    When an HL-7 message with Lab order "outside report range" and "Positive" Lab result "within report range" is sent
    Then the "numerator and denominator" of "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" under "core set" should be "increased" by "0"
    And "invalid record" should not be in "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" numerator report under "core set"

    When an HL-7 message with Lab order "outside report range" and "Negative" Lab result "outside report range" is sent
    Then the "numerator and denominator" of "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" under "core set" should be "increased" by "0"
    And "invalid record" should not be in "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" numerator report under "core set"

  @tc_6241
  Scenario: Verification of Stage 2 Incorporate Clinical Lab Results takes into account for HL7 lab order having multiple results
    And get "all" details of "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" under "core set" for "stage2 ep" as "within report range"
    When an HL-7 message with Lab order "within report range" and "Multiple" Lab results "within report range" is sent
    Then the "numerator and denominator" of "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" under "core set" should be "increased" by "3"
    And "a record" should be in "Incorporate Clinical Lab Results" numerator report under "core set"
