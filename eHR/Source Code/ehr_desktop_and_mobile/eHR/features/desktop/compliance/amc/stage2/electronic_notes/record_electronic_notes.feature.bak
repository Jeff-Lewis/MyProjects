  Background:
    Given login as "non EP"

  Scenario: Verify Help text and Requirement column value for Record Electronic Notes stage 2 AMC
    Then get "requirement" details of "record electronic notes" under "menu set" for "stage2 ep" as "within report range"
    And the "requirement" of "record electronic notes" under "menu set" should be "equal" to "30"
    And get help text of "record electronic notes" under "menu set" from tooltip
    And help text for "record electronic notes" should be equal to the text
    """
    Enter at least one electronic progress note created, edited and signed by an EP for more than 30 percent of unique patients with at least one office visit during the EHR reporting period. The text of the electronic note must be text searchable and may contain drawings and other content
